His life is nothing less than the story of Robert, The Bruce and the Spider, that we were taught as kindergartens. This is the story of Jack Ma.</p>

<h2>So, Who is Jack Ma ?</h2>

<P>Jack Ma is the founder of the E-commerce giant Alibaba and is a stakeholder at Alipay, its sister company which is an e-payment portal. He is now officially the richest man in China with an estimated net worth of $25 Billion, on the back of the recent world record $150 Billion IPO filing of his company. Given all of this, Jack Ma only holds a 7.8% stake in Alibaba and a 50% stake in Alipay. Alibaba and Jack Ma, although are not household names out of China, you must know that Alibaba is worth more than Facebook, and processes goods more than eBay and Amazon combined!</P>

<h2>Here are some insane qoutes by Jack ma that will change your mind about life </h2>
<ol>
	<li>It doesn't matter if I failed. At least I passed the concept on to others. Even if I don't succeed, someone will succeed.</li>
	<li>If we are a good team and know what we want to do, one of us can defeat ten of them.</li>
	<li>Intelligent people need a fool to lead them. When the team's all a bunch of scientists, it is best to have a peasant lead the way. His way of thinking is different. It's easier to win if you have people seeing things from different perspectives.</li> 
    <li>The dark days at Alibaba": "If you don't give up, you still have a chance. And when you are small, you have to be very focused and rely on your brain, not your strength.</li>
</ol>
<p> This is the last but not the least and my all time favourite. </p>
